\subsection{Performance Measures}
These anonymization algorithms were implemented in C++ and run on Intel Core i7 CPU, 2 GHZ, 6MB cache size. We plot their running times on on tested datasets (PPI, BK, DBLP) in Figure~\ref{fig:time}. For larger values for anonymity level $k$, all the methods take more time to find the sanitized solutions. It is because the increased efforts (more noises \& more modified edges) needed to achieve the higher anonymity level (larger values of $k$). 
In comparison, our {\methodName} achieves the comparable efficiency with RA and CA methods.  

As excepted, the time efficiency of our {\methodName} is close to RA, better than CA.
{\methodName} and RA use the randomized search strategy to identify sanitized uncertain solutions using the given standard deviation $\sigma$, while {\methodName} takes a connectivity model instead of degree sequence adopted in RA. 
The computation generalized uniqueness and relevance metrics can be finished off-line.
As we mentioned, multi-heuristics can co-boost the randomized search strategy in the quite straightforward way with little extra effort.
