\textbf{Edge Selection Boosted by Multi-heuristics}~~
To get the balance between anonymity and utility, we combined the generalized uniqueness metric $U$ and relevance $R$ metric by taking the ratio between them. 
We denote the combination as Balance Factor (BF) which is defined as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    BF(v)=\frac{U(v)}{R(v)}
\end{equation*}
For a give vertex $v$, $U(v)$ is the normalized uniqueness score of its property value among all the node in the original graph; $R(v)$ is the sum of reliability relevance of edges adjacent to the vertex. 
The higher value of BF represents the better trade-off between anonymity preserving and utility preserving. 
Our algorithm uses this heuristic to select and perturb the edge of uncertain graphs, as outlined in Algorithm 2.
