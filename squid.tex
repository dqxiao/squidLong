\section{Privacy Via {\capMethodName}}
\label{sec:method}
In this section we describe our algorithm, {\methodName}, which injects uncertainty to the given uncertain graph so that it becomes {\keobf} while preserving as much the stochastic nature as possible. 
A key feature of our method is to seamlessly integrate edge uncertainty and possible world semantics into the core of anonymization operators.
